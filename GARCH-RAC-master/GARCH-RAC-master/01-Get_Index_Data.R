# A Garch Tutorial with R - Get Index data from Yahoo Finance
# Paper at <https://rac.anpad.org.br/index.php/rac/article/view/1420>
#
# This script will import price data for market index Ibovespa (or any other) from Yahoo Finance.
# 
# The resulting dataset is serialized (saved) in a rds file named data/RAC-GARCH-Data.rds,
# to be used in the next step.

## MAIN OPTIONS (fell free to edit it)

first_date <- '2000-01-01' # first date in sample ("2000-01-01" in paper)
last_date <- '2020-06-15' # set Sys.Date() for current date ("2020-06-01" in paper)
my_ticker <- '^BVSP' # Ibovespa ticker (fell free to change to any 
                     # other from YFinance: ^GSCP, ^FTSE, ITSA3.SA
                     # head over to https://finance.yahoo.com/ for more tickers
series_name <- 'Ibovespa' # Name of index/stock that will show up in all plots
