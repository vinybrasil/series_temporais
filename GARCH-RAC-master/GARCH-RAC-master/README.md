## Instructions

1) Install latest version of R ([link](https://cloud.r-project.org/) )

2) Install latest version of RStudio ([link](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/))

3) Download [zip file](https://github.com/msperlin/GARCH-RAC/archive/master.zip) from this repository.

4) Unzip the content of zip file in a personal folder

5) Run first script _00-Prepare_Computer.R_ to install all dependencies of the code. For that, in RStudio, open R script file and press _control + shift + enter_

6) Execute other scripts in root folder in order to reproduce all results from the paper
